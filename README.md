# split-psu-15v

## Concept

This is a basic split-rail power supply to support my analog projects.
It's also my first power-related project, so a learning experience.
Thankfully the datasheet for the main PMIC is quite nice to follow.
That PMIC being the TPS65131 from TI.

## Status

Waiting to receive boards and parts. Hoping for the best.
